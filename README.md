### Credit check with 4-eyes principle

A customer's credit application is approved immediately if the credit amount is below the credit rating assigned to each customer. Otherwise, two different employees are asked to propose a decision; these proposals are evaluated personally by the superior of these employees and a decision is made.  In the case of decisions on loan amounts in excess of 500,000, the Bank's management is also involved in the decision. Subsequently (if the application is accepted) a loan is created for the client with a term, interest rate and loan amount.
